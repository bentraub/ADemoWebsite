              man oh man can i tell you about my day. holy moley its like its not going to end. so i had a whole 9 hour day at work yesterday, sales. its the wurst! even had a meeting about quitting my department to move to another but I'm ruining my team averages with fatty 0's. so then i started this class last night and was pretty happy about it when doing it but it made me nervous in the middle of the night. maybe it was rise of skywalker? maybe just being so tired and too much screen time.... anywhow... this morning i forgot to clock into work and my doctor was 30 mintues late to our video meeting but he was super short with me and we dicided to double the meds for now. holy moley... absolutely nothing day at work EXCEPT for an interview for the new gig but it went too fast and i made the jerking motion a lot when talking to some kid. it'll be a pay cut but i'll have a chance at actually taking time off with earned time and maybe even spend time with my family and go on a trip to anywhere, usa. now im doing this and building a page that is my first time writing code and if i practice this enough maybe i wont drop out of a class that costs more than 6 months mortgage.
